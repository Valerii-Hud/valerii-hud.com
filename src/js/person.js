  description: ` Hi! My name is Valerii Hud, I am 16 years old and I am a frontend
              developer. My journey into the world of code began in 2023. I work
              with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Gulp, Vite, Git and PostCSS. In the
              coming year, I plan to master React, Next.js and TypeScript, and
              then learn the basics of the backend (Node.js, PostgreSQL,
              MongoDB)`,
